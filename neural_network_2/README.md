Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera.

This a second assignment on week 5
Task is a bout how to apply Neural Networks Learning on data set.
I am using Octave Language to complete this task.


you can find a helpful material & conclusion for week 5 designed by me for Arabic user.

some of screen shots I used from Coursera Materials and Youtube channel by Eng: Hesham Asem.

all tasks solved which are:

Feedforward and Cost Function
Regularized Cost Function
Sigmoid Gradient
NeuralNetGradientFunction(Backpropagation)
Regularized Gradient


also you will see all of task requirements uploaded with file name: ex4.
