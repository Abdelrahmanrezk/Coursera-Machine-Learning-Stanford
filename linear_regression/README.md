Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera.

This a first assignment on week 1 and 2
Task is a bout how to apply linear regression on data set.
I am using Octave Language to complete this task.


you can find a helpful material & conclusion for these two weeks designed by me for Arabic user.

first file called Week1_2_styudying_equtions which is conclusion of all equtions with solved examples to help you connect all of these on one and simple file.
also there another file called week 1 & 2 which is related to my studying on these two week.
some of screen shots I used from Coursera Materials and Youtube channel by Eng: Hesham Asem.

all required and optional Tasks solved which are:

cost function using non vectorized version with one variable.
cost function using vectorized version with one variable.

gradient descent using non vectorized version with one variable.
gradient descent using vectorized version with one variable.


cost function using non vectorized version with multiple variables.
cost function using vectorized version with multiple variables.

gradient descent using non vectorized version with multiple variables.
gradient descent using vectorized version with multiple variables.

Normal Equation
Features Scaling and normalization techniques.

also you will see all of task requirements uploaded with file name: ex1.
