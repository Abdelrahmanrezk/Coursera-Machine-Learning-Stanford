Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera.

This a second assignment on week 3
Task is a bout how to apply Logistic regression on data set.
I am using Octave Language to complete this task.


you can find a helpful material & conclusion for week 3 designed by me for Arabic user.

first file called Classification_equtions which is conclusion of all equtions with solved examples to help you connect all of these on one and simple file.
also there another file called Week_3_Classification which is related to my studying on  week 3.
some of screen shots I used from Coursera Materials and Youtube channel by Eng: Hesham Asem.

all tasks solved which are:

sigmoid function
cost function using vectorized version.
gradient descent using vectorized version.
predict
cost function using vectorized version & regularization.
gradient descent using vectorized version & regularization.



also you will see all of task requirements uploaded with file name: ex2.
